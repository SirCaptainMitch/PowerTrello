We should add a synthetic key to this table, PK and Cluster on that. Then create a NonClusteredIndex on ZoneMatrixId, TierID, FreightMatrixId.

In my local DB the optimizer was generating much better plans for this schema vs the current one. This does mean dropping and Recreating things on the table.

The simple customer request below is far more work than it should be to manage on our side.  We need a fix please.

Subject: HELP

Good Morning,

BOL # 062910456 needs the pickup date changed to 9/1 please.  I messed up.

Thanks.

Deb Roberts
PA Transformer
Traffic Coordinator

I run across this now and again and would assume others do as well.  While there is a bandaid fix of having the customer manually change the date by pen and LPS staff trying to rememeber not to duispatch the load for an entire day I would like to see a solution put in place.  

The below tool was created for Smart Mailers and SunOpta due to the frequency of these typoe of requests.  Why can we not open this up to ALL customers?

 

We can make a note in KSX Admin to remind LPS staff not to dispatch but that?s all.  This is easily missed.

Need to calculate ?cube wt? for any shipment were the total PCF is under 10. Cube wt. calculation is below:
If PCF .0001 ? 10 PCF- PCF applied is 10 PCF. 

Example:
Actual shipment specs:
?	1 pallet. 
?	48x48x96?
?	200 lbs
?	1.56 PCF
?	128 cubic feet

Since its under 10PCF, Day and Ross multiplies the total cubic feet by 10pcf.
128 cu. Ft x 10 pcf= 1280 lbs cube weight.  

In above example, the rate returned should be based on 1280 lbs, NOT the actual weight of 200 lbs. 


If PCF is 10pcf+- rates return same as it does today
If no DIMS are entered, do NOT return carrier as option.

We have modified the reporting tool to connect to our new infrastructure. Will you try to install/run the modified app from this location: \\LPSDC09\Shared\Information Technology\DesktopReportingClient? Just run the setup.exe installer. It's possible you'll be notified that you already have that program installed. If that happens, you'll first have to uninstall the existing LPS.Reporting.Client program (Windows 'Uninstall a Program') and then rerun the installer. This isn't the normal install location for this application, but I don't have permissions to update the files in the normal location. Right now, I just want to confirm that you can get to the reports with the changes I've made.

 - Ensure date on this message is today or tomorrow?s date
 - Please confirm if any issues, or if you need to set up your system to accept these PNs

From Matt:

 - First we are testing the connectivity of the test instances to make sure that files are flowing from Ericsson?s test environment to CRST STIs test environment to the LPS test environment.  We just need confirmation from Beau that the test files have been received on LPS test FTP site.
 
 - Second Ericsson needs confirmation that the test files that were received have processed into your test system without any issues.

LPS Reporting Client ? KSX Users is the current report that we used to get the user data and found that it only pulls active users up to 2014, so we would either need this report updated or a new one created with the following info:
 
all KSX user email addresses (critical)
attached to customer ID (critical)
company name (critical)
customer status (critical)
created date (critical)
last time that user created a shipment / last shipment date (critical)

First name attached to each user (should have)
YTD sales (should have)
Company name/customer name (should have)
last login date (should have)
Last name (nice to have)
 
There are 6 critical items needed, the rest would be really helpful to have as we currently merge those from another report/file using excel vlookups, but if it isn?t possible or really slows down the project, then we can make do with just the critical items.

Issue Description: Everyday at 6am CT a file is emailed and dropped to EMD & LPS whether or not invoices are batched.   When the user (Kay Ledux) approves a batch it should tie in .  This appears to be a report that runs at a specific time. Yesterday Kay approved the batch.  Then this morning no email was sent to the team & from her side the file wasn?t in her queue.  That is where my leap is we might have found another one off connection as we discussed yesterday.



Steps to Reproduce:

no email was sent to the team this morning

Users Affected:
EMD@shiplps.com & kledoux2@curtisswright.com (Kay Ledoux)
