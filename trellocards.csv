When an audit fails, the bill should be cut to the contacted/audited rate, and then processed per the customer rules.  
 
Once the customer approves/funds their freight invoices, a remittance file is sent to the carrier, with their specific audit adjustment codes.
 
No one at LPS should ever see these shipments, everything is automated - although a daily report would be good to be able to see the impact of audit/count and type of adjustments.
